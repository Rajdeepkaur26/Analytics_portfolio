# Agentic AI Voice Assistant – PlayStayTion Pet Resort

## Project Overview
This project documents the design of an **agentic AI voice assistant** created as a business-facing feasibility solution for *PlayStayTion Pet Resort*. The goal was to automate high-volume inbound customer calls related to bookings, FAQs, and general inquiries while maintaining service quality, control, and governance.

The solution was designed using **Voiceflow** and **Twilio** during an active subscription period and presented to business stakeholders as a conceptual and functional prototype.

## Business Problem
PlayStayTion Pet Resort receives frequent inbound calls for:
- Booking inquiries
- Operating hours and service FAQs
- Basic customer support questions

Manual call handling created:
- Operational bottlenecks
- Inconsistent responses
- Limited scalability during peak periods

---

## Solution Design
The proposed solution uses an **agentic AI workflow** that:
- Classifies caller intent
- Retrieves accurate responses using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**
- Escalates to a human agent when confidence is low or requests are complex

Key components:
- Intent classification and routing
- Knowledge grounding via structured business data
- Human-in-the-loop escalation
- Call logging and analytics for continuous improvement

---

## Tools & Platforms
- Voiceflow (agent design and conversation flow)
- Twilio (telephony integration)
- Conversational AI & RAG (conceptual implementation)
- Prompt engineering and intent modeling

> **Note:** Live deployment is no longer active due to subscription expiration. This repository preserves the system design, logic, and governance decisions presented to business clients.

## Governance & Risk Considerations
- Prevention of hallucinated responses through knowledge grounding
- Escalation rules to avoid automation overreach
- Transparency in AI-driven customer interactions
- Responsible AI usage in customer-facing systems

---

## Deliverables
- Final project report (business and technical documentation)
- Client-facing presentation
- Architecture and workflow documentation

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Agentic AI system design
- Conversational AI & voice workflows
- Business problem framing
- AI governance and risk analysis
- Stakeholder-oriented solution design
