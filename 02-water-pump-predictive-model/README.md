# Water Pump Predictive Model – Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating **machine learning classification models** to predict water pump functionality using structured operational data. The objective was to support **risk-based decision-making** by identifying pumps likely to fail and require maintenance.

## Business Problem
Water infrastructure failures can disrupt access, increase costs, and delay intervention.
Manual monitoring is inefficient and reactive.

This project explores how **predictive analytics** can be used to:
- Anticipate failures before breakdown
- Prioritize maintenance resources
- Improve infrastructure reliability
