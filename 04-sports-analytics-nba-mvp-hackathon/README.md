# Sports Analytics Hackathon – NBA MVP Prediction (2010–2024)

## Project Overview
This project was developed during a **sports analytics hackathon** at the University of North Texas. Working as part of **Team Data Dribblers**, we analyzed decades of NBA/ABA/BAA player performance and award data to identify the key factors that define **Most Valuable Player (MVP)** selection.

The goal was to apply **AI and advanced analytics** to a real-world sports decision problem and derive interpretable, data-driven insights.

---

## Hackathon Context
- Multi-team competitive analytics event
- Real-world sports datasets
- Time-constrained problem solving
- Team-based collaboration

---

## Business / Analytics Problem
MVP selection is often perceived as subjective.
This project explored how **data-driven models** can:
- Identify performance attributes most correlated with MVP outcomes
- Reduce bias in award evaluation
- Explain historical MVP voting patterns

---

## Data & Analytical Approach
- Historical NBA player statistics and award voting data
- Data cleaning, merging, and preprocessing
- Feature engineering to capture:
  - Player efficiency
  - Team impact
  - Season consistency
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Predictive modeling to assess MVP likelihood

---

## Key Insights
- Player efficiency, win shares, and team success strongly influence MVP outcomes
- MVPs consistently outperform peers on usage-adjusted impact metrics
- High-impact, well-rounded performance matters more than scoring alone

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Data visualization libraries
- Excel (dataset preparation)

---

## Team
**Team Name:** Data Dribblers  
**Team Members:** Saketh, Rajdeep Kaur Sandhu, Sulav Regmi, Wanlin Cui

---

## Deliverables
